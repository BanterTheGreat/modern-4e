    = Backgrounds
    Backgrounds represent an adventurer’s past, training, and unique skills. They provide bonuses to skill checks when relevant to the situation.

Each background has a total of five ranks. When a skill check is made and a background is applicable, it grants a +1 bonus per rank. Only one background can be applied to a skill check, and it must be chosen before rolling.

Backgrounds should be specific and evocative to reflect a character’s history. For example, rather than simply using “Acrobat,” a background like “Acrobat Performer for the Demon Circus” adds more depth and context.

Examples of background skills include:
- Trollwrestling Champion
- An Eye for Lies
- Royal Assassin

When creating a background, consider where it will be most relevant. If a background could apply to almost any skill check, it should be narrowed to focus on more specific situations. A well-crafted background is one that enhances roleplay and offers a clear advantage when applied appropriately.

= Titles
When the stories of your adventurer and their fellow adventurers become legend, how will they be remembered? What will they be called when their name falls into obscurity and all that survives is their deeds? People will recognize your adventurer by this title, even if they don’t know their name. Titles can reference anything from a fighting style to a physical trait, or even an aesthetic.

Example Titles:
- The Green Knight
- The Herald of Silence
- The Bosstown Bludgeon
- Moonfang
- The Timeless Bard

Whenever you make a skill check, you can invoke your adventurer’s title before rolling to gain a +2 bonus.
To invoke a title, the action in question must contribute to the legend of your adventurer's title. Think of a story being told about your adventurer, where their name is lost to history and only their title survives. Would this action make it into the story?

== Example:
Shawn likes the idea of playing someone smart; a knowledge-seeker. She gives Dhalia the title of "The All-Knowing." Shawn can invoke this title when doing something that contributes to the legacy of “The All-Knowing.” For example, if Dhalia is making a skill check to piece together a conspiracy, she can invoke her title to gain a +2 bonus. If Dhalia is making a skill check to climb a mountain, the title wouldn’t apply since it doesn't contribute to her being “All-Knowing.”

== Rephrasing Titles for Balance:
If you find that your title is too easy to invoke, consider rephrasing it to limit its scope. For example, Delmar’s adventurer is Dmitri, “The Demigod.” After a few sessions, Delmar realizes that “The Demigod” can be invoked in every situation. Delmar rephrases it as “The Demigod of Determination”, which limits when it can be invoked.
