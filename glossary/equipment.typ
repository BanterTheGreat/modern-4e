    = Properties
    #columns(2)[
      == Balanced
      A balanced weapon is particularly easy to maneuver under pressure. A proficient character wielding only weapons with the balanced property reduces their armor check penalty to skill and ability checks by 2 while in combat, and when you replace the ability score for the melee basic attack power or ranged basic attack power using a balanced weapon, you may use the full replacement ability score, rather than half, for the associated damage roll.

      == Brutal
      A brutal weapon's minimum damage is higher than that of a normal weapon. When rolling the damage from a weapon attack made with a brutal weapon, reroll any damage die that displays a value of 2 or lower until it shows 3 or greater, then use the new value.

      == Defensive
      A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield at least one defensive weapon you are proficient with. Multiple defensive weapons do not stack.

      == Severe
      A severe weapon's maximum damage is higher than that of a normal weapon.
      When rolling the damage from a weapon attack made with a severe weapon, whenever you roll a die that displays its maximum value, that die explodes: roll a second damage die of the same size, and add these dice to the original roll as extra damage.

      #colbreak();

      == High Crit
      A high crit weapon deals more damage when you score a critical hit with it.
      A critical hit with a weapon attack deals maximum rolled damage and an extra [W] based on level:
      - 1[W] at 1st–5th levels
      - 2[W] at 6th–10th levels
      - 3[W] at 11th–15th levels
      - 4[W] at 16th–20th levels
      - 5[W] at 21st–25th levels
      - 6[W] at 26th–30th levels
      This extra damage is in addition to any critical damage the weapon supplies if it is a magic weapon.

      == Innocuous
      Weapons with the innocuous keyword easily pass as peaceful tools.
      A character visibly carrying only an innocuous weapon adds its proficiency bonus to any check made to pretend they are not armed.

      === Thrown
      A thrown weapon may be used to make ranged attacks without penalty.
      You hurl most thrown weapons from your hand, rather than using the weapon to loose a projectile.

      A thrown weapon with a specified load speed is instead a launcher that can be used with enchanted ammunition if desired-- the launcher is not thrown at the target.

      == Implement
      A weapon with the Implement property may be used as an implement, even if they are held in only one hand.
    ]

    #pagebreak();

    == Versatile
    Versatile weapons are one-handed but deal bonus damage and qualify as a two-handed weapon for power riders and requirements when supported with a second hand.
    This bonus is equal to:
    - +1 to each `[W]` die at levels 1–10
    - +2 at levels 11–20
    - +3 at levels 21–30

    The versatile bonus may be gained by supporting the weapon with an off-hand occupied by a light shield or weapon in the unarmed group, but no bonuses from the item equipped in the off-hand apply to the attack, and the unarmed weapon cannot be used to attack until the grip is released.
    Changing grip is a free action.
